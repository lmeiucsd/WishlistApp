## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had trouble figuring out how to connect the RecyclerView code to MainActivity code. Once I figured it out, it appeared that only one item was appearing and any subsequent item would not be shown. But I realized that the items were shown but had an entire screen's worth of padding between them, so I changed the layout_height to wrap_content and the padding to 10dp to solve that issue. I also had an issue where the RecyclerView took the entire screen despite its height being around 3/4 of the screen. I fixed this by realizing that the RecyclerView was missing a constraint at the bottom so I added one.
